## Code and data to perform impersonator attacks using Genetic Algorithms.

### This is the code to reproduce the results of the paper:

"A Genetic Attack Against Machine Learning Classifiers to Steal Biometric Actigraphy Profiles from Health Related Sensor Data", Enrique Garcia-Ceja, Brice Morin, Anton Aguilar Rivera, Michael Riegler, Journal of Medical Systems, 2020.


The 'data' folder contains a subdirectory 'features' with the dataset. The subdirectory 'results' contains the generated results after running the experiments.

This code was tesded on Windows 10 and R version 3.5.1 with library versions:

caret: 6.0-81

dplyr: 0.7.8

reshape2: 1.4.3

randomForest: 4.6-14

e1071: 1.7-0

GA: 3.2
